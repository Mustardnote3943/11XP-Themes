# 11XP-Themes

THE FILES AREN'T OWNED BY ME EXCEPT THE .THEME FILES. THIS IS JUST TO PACK ALL OF THEM TOGETHER SO I DON'T AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO FIND THEM AGAIN.

These themes are for Retrobar, Open Shell. I also use ExplorerPatcher, Windows XP shutdown screen remake, and, Winaero Tweaker. they make it seem more like XP. It was only tested on Windows 11. not sure if it works on Windows 10 or below.
also, please let me know if it works on Windows 10 or below. this is packed with Themes, Wallpaper, and open-shell skins. when you put on the theme, you need to add wallpaper.
I found these wallpapers and open shell skins from websites. I might make a tutorial on how to make Windows 11 look like XP.
I packed them together. please know there may be some issues in Windows 11 like turning the aero lite theme will give you a sort of light theme bar on file explorer.

there is plenty of wallpapers.
I added cursors from Windows XP on VM. it has more cursors.
(also, I lost my whole paragraphs. so I had to retype. I had no internet.)

INSTRUCTIONS:
Windows Theme files for Windows 11. you need to throw them into the Theme folder. To do that so to do Win key + R then type in %LocalAppData%\Microsoft\Windows\Themes
then drag the theme files in there and then the Windows theme customization tool from Windows settings should show your themes. also, you would have to add the wallpapers too which I'm including.

for the open shell skin to go to C:\Program Files\Open-Shell\Skins then drag the skins into the folder. YOU NEED TO throw in the 2 two folders which are named "XML Menu Settings" and "Extra icon  images if need to include them in the second column".

UPDATE: added a file that fixes the windows vista start menu shutdown button's size.
