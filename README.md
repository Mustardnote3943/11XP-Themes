# XP-Vista-Themes

The purpose of doing this is to gather resources here for customizing Windows 10/11 to make it easily accessible for those who want to customize Windows. although, it may be aimed more at old Windows themes like 2000, XP, Vista, etc.


THE FILES AREN'T OWNED BY ME EXCEPT THE .THEME FILES. THIS IS JUST TO PACK ALL OF THEM TOGETHER SO I DON'T AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO FIND THEM AGAIN.

These themes are for Retrobar (https://github.com/dremin/RetroBar), and Open Shell (https://open-shell.github.io/Open-Shell-Menu/). I also use ExplorerPatcher (https://github.com/valinet/ExplorerPatcher), Windows XP shutdown screen remake, and, Winaero Tweaker (https://winaerotweaker.com/). they make it seem more like XP. It was only tested on Windows 11. not sure if it works on Windows 10 or below.
also, please let me know if it works on Windows 10 or below. this is packed with Themes, Wallpaper, and open-shell skins. when you put on the theme, you need to add wallpaper.
I found these wallpapers and open shell skins from websites. I might make a tutorial on how to make Windows 11 look like XP.
I packed them together. please know there may be some issues in Windows 11 like turning the Aero Lite theme will give you a sort of light theme bar on File Explorer.

there are plenty of wallpapers.
I added cursors from Windows XP on the VM. it has more cursors.
(Also, I lost all my paragraphs. so I had to retype. I had no internet.)

INSTRUCTIONS:
Windows Theme files for Windows 11. you need to throw them into the Theme folder. To do that so to do Win key + R then type in %LocalAppData%\Microsoft\Windows\Themes
then drag the theme files in there and the Windows theme customization tool from Windows settings should show your themes. also, you would have to add the wallpapers, which I'm including.

for the open shell skin go to C:\Program Files\Open-Shell\Skins then drag the skins into the folder. YOU NEED TO throw in the 2 two folders which are named "XML Menu Settings" and "Extra icon  images if need to include them in the second column".

but these folders probably do nothing, possibly.

https://weedtrek.ca/XPshutdown.html (the download page)
https://weedtrek.ca This is down as well.
https://www.tenforums.com/customization/172843-windows-xp-shutdown-logoff-menus-modern-windows.html (forum website and it's not down)

(anyways, the zip file is called XP_shutdown)
okay, a little quick note, you might need Winaero tweaker for basicthemer2 and change the window's border in Winaero tweaker to match the basic theme's original size which is:

Border width: 1
Border padding: 4

then apply changes

UPDATE 1: added a file that fixes the Windows Vista start menu shutdown button's size. I believe it is the file named "StartMenuL10N.ini", that might be it BUT once you do replace the file with this file in the open shell directory, I think some start menu themes would be broken. you might be able to do the windows vista theme yourself, make sure you use basicthemer2 as it gives the windows vista/7 theme. (https://github.com/Ingan121/BasicThemer2) I also decided to add in Windows XP Shutdown and Logoff menus for modern Windows, I did this because the 2 websites are down, and here is a forum of his post:

UPDATE 2: Added Windows Vista start menu. use StartMenuL10N.ini with the start menu so it'll fix the button

UPDATE 3: I think this will be useful so here: https://drive.usercontent.google.com/download?id=1LWlkJbwnGp-FVywSeQcXob_sbqaI7ies&export=download&confirm=t&uuid=4dc64e9c-6b15-4319-aaa5-b17372a86221 

I found this somewhere on the internet and it's meant for Windows 11. This is just the download link from google drive. there is some useful stuff like changing the icons and micaforeveryone which lets you get translucent windows. this will just be here for easy access since it is somewhere in a forum.

here's a youtube video I found about transforming windows 10 to windows vista: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_IEQpvvZ8g
