# 11XP-Themes
These themes are for Retrobar, Open Shell. i also use ExplorerPatcher, Windows XP shutdown screen remake and, Winaero Tweaker. they make it seem more like XP. it was only tested on Windows 11. not sure if it works on windows 10 or below.
also, please let me know if it works on windows 10 or below. this is packed with Themes, Wallpapers and open shell skins. when you put on the theme, you need to add a wallpaper.
i found these wallpapers and open shell skins from websites. i might make a tutorial on how to make Windows 11 look like XP.
i packed them together. please know there may some issues in Windows 11 like turning aero lite theme will give you sort of light theme bar on file explorer.

(also, i lost my whole paragraphs. so i had to retype. i had no internet.)
