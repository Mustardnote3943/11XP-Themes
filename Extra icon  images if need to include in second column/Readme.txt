These are not icons.
They are different sizes of icon images.

If you want to include this on bottom of 2nd column, use the custom image skin option.
Select the matching size for the menu size.
Example: Size 24 pixels is only good for 100% (normal 96DPI).
Then you have to set up the command/link in Customize tab of CSM settings. 

It's a bit of a hassle to extract separate images from icons, especially because 36 pixel size is rare. 
A 48 size would need to be resized in an image editor, down to 36p.
